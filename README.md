# EVGP Data Collection and Visualization System

This project is a data collection and visualization system for an electric race car using two Raspberry Pis and a CC1101 Radio module. The Pi collects data, stores it in an SQLite3 database, and transmits it to a pit station. The station stores the data in another SQLite database and visualizes it through a web interface.

### Who Are We?

The Harrisonburg High School Electric Vehicle Grand Prix team is a student-run racing team that builds an electric car and races it in an endurance race. As of 2025, we are a four-year-old team, and from the start, live data has been an important part of our race strategy.

## System Structure & Running coming soon
